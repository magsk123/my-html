I want to graduated as GDD student. To be GDD student isn't tasks it might be hard for me to sleep tired and will woke up early dizzy and not feeling well. I will take it as a challenge to me just to be a good citizen,good person, wont become a lazy man.
I just want to be simple as i am right now. I know we will face the difficulties as the day goes on. We need to strengthen our relationship to overcome this hindrances. We might encounter and also need the guidance of the lord as we go on the path that we made.
